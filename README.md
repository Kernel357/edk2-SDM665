# edk2-mi_a3

The beginning of my journey in EDK2 UEFI...

This is an implementation of EDK2 on Mi A3 4/64 (SDM665). So far, almost nothing works :( There is debug output via Framebuffer. Now we have a problem in initializing the MMU, so the DXE kernel does not start... This was created based on edk2-lavender by serdeliuk.

Who wants to help, write to torbama35@gmail.com.

Thanks for attention!
